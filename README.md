# Alt viewer - An image comparison tool

A small React app to compare images with their alt versions.
The live version is at: https://alt.spangle.org.uk/

It currently has three viewers:
- Hover: flip between the foreground and background image when the mouse hovers over it.
- Vertical split: Split between the foreground and background image with a vertical separator aligned to your cursor.
- Horizontal split: Split between the foreground and background  image with a horizontal separator aligned to your cursor.

There are plans for more viewers.

The URL updates when you specify the images or viewer style too, making the link sharable to show others the image comparison!
